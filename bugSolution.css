To correct this behavior, we need to avoid relying on inheritance when using `!important` for nested elements. Instead, explicitly target the nested `<span>` element within the `.container div` with a more specific selector:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container div {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.container div span {
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

This revised CSS ensures that the `font-size: 14px` is applied directly to the nested `<span>` element, resolving the unexpected behavior caused by inheritance.  The `!important` declaration is removed to promote more predictable and maintainable style rules.
